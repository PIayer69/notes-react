# NoteTakingApp
Minimalistic web app developed in ReactJS and Django. My first try on working with Rest Framework, and at the same time learning React basics. 

## What I've learned so far
Basics of React:
- How to use Hooks (useEffect, useState)
- Operating on useState lists, dictionaries (creating, editing, deleting)
- Working with components
- Simple routes with *react-router-dom* and redirecting with *useNavigate*
- How to use *react-icons*

Django Rest Framework:
- APIViews
- ModelViewsets
- Permissions
- SimpleJWT concept (how tokens are structured, what is refresh token rotating, what are sliding tokens)

## Things that still needs to be done:
- Feedback (Disabling button on press, Info on error, etc.)
- Get rid of double API calls (probably somtehing to do with useEffect)
- Information when data is loading

Optional: 
- Page transitions
- Animations

# NoteTakingApp

Minimalistic web app developed in ReactJS and Django. My first try on working with Rest Framework, and at the same time learning React basics.

## What I've learned so far

Basics of React:

- How to use Hooks (useEffect, useState)
- Operating on useState lists, dictionaries (creating, editing, deleting)
- Working with components
- Simple routes with _react-router-dom_ and redirecting with _useNavigate_
- How to use _react-icons_

Django Rest Framework:

- APIViews
- ModelViewsets
- Permissions
- SimpleJWT concept (how tokens are structured, what is refresh token rotating, what are sliding tokens, token blacklisting)

## Things that still needs to be done:

- Feedback (Disabling button on press, Info on error, etc.)
- Information when data is loading

Optional:

- Page transitions
- Animations
